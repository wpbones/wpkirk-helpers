WP Kirk Helpers is a (internal) package that provides a set of functions to help you to develop a WP bones Boilerplate plugin.

## Installation

You can install third party packages by using:

```sh
php bones require wpbones/helpers
```

I advise to use this command instead of `composer require` because doing this an automatic renaming will done.

You can use composer to install this package:

```sh
composer require wpbones/helpers
```

You may also to add `"wpbones/wpkirk-helpers": "~1.0"` in the `composer.json` file of your plugin:

```json
  "require": {
    "php": ">=7.4.0",
    "wpbones/wpbones": "~1.7",
    "wpbones/wpkirk-helpers": "~1.0"
  },
```

and run

```sh
composer install
```
